            Started in the middle of the pandemic in 2020, this project hopes to become a
            comprehensive and updated database of astrochemists from across the globe. As
            of July 2021, the list has more than 400 names and counting! This database has
            two main aims: to make the astrochemical community more accessible to newcomers
            by allowing them to contact its members easily for help and advice, and to allow
            the astrochemical community to connect more easily with itself.
