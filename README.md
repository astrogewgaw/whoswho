## A list of astrochemists 🧪 🌌 from across the globe 🌏 !

<div align="justify">

This repository is behind the [**whoswho**][whoswho] page, a list of astrochemists from across the globe. I started this project last year, after getting a lot of enthusiastic responses to a tweet that I posted with the idea. As an undergrad who wished to pursue a career in the field of astrochemistry, the biggest obstacle I faced was the lack of guidance. I had a lot of questions, but I had no idea who to ask them to. I started maintaining a hand-written list of astrochemists. That list eventually turned into a page on my personal website. I took down the page temporarily in 2021, with an intention of converting the list into a dedicated web application. That is what this project os about. It is still very much a work-in-progress, since I am still learning my way around Javascript and the React and NextJS frameworks. If you wish to contribute, feel free 😁 !

I hope that this project helps people connect to the astrochemical community 🔗 !
