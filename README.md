## A list 📝 of astrochemists 🧪 from across the globe 🌏 !

</div>

<div align="justify">

This project is an open-source, version-controlled contact list for astrochemists across the globe. It started as a hand-written list that I maintained for several years. That all changed last year, when I floated the idea of converting it into a version that would be maintained by the community and hosted on the web. The idea got a lot of appreciation, particularly from fellow astrochemists. A previous version of this list was hosted on my personal website. The development has now shifted to a sub-domain, with the web application being powered by the brilliant [**lowdefy**][lowdefy] framework. The source code, which is just a bunch of YAML files, can be found [*here*][repo]. This project relies heavily on the support of both the open-source and astrochemical communities. If you are a fellow astrochemist yourself, consider adding, editing or updating the list using the form [*here*][edits].
