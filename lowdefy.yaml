# Adding a connection to the Google Sheets API. This is not

# but their contact details have changed.

# Adding pages to the web app. These are added as references
# to the appropriate YAML files in the pages directory. There
# are four pages in the Who's Who application:
#
#   1. An about page. This describes what the Who's Who is all
#      about, how it started, and how to contribute to it.
#   2. The list. This is where the list is displayed as a table.
#   3. The edits form. This is where any user can submit edits
#      to the Who's Who database.
#   4. The world map. This is where we display a dynamic world
#      map of astrochemists.
